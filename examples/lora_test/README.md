## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Options

### Module Parameters
The sketches are pre-configured with the following settings:

```cpp
// LoRa Configuration
#define LORA_FREQUENCY 915    // MHz (US band)
#define LORA_POWER 22         // dBm (configurable: 10-30)
#define LORA_CHANNEL 23       // Channel number
```

### Regional Settings
- **United States**: Use 915MHz (default)
- **Europe**: Change to 868MHz
- **Other regions**: Check local LoRa frequency regulations

### Transmission Timing
```cpp
#define TRANSMISSION_INTERVAL 2000  // 2 seconds between messages
```

### Status Updates
```cpp
#define STATUS_UPDATE_INTERVAL 10000  // 10 seconds between status reports
```

## üîß Customization

### Changing Device Names
In the transmitter sketch:
```cpp
#define DEVICE_ID "Device A"    // Change to any name
```

### Adjusting Transmission Power
```cpp
#define LORA_POWER 22    // Range: 10-30 dBm
```
- **Lower power**: Shorter range, less power consumption
- **Higher power**: Longer range, more power consumption

### Modifying Message Content
Edit the `sendTestMessage()` function in the transmitter:
```cpp
String message = "Hello from " + String(DEVICE_ID) + " - Count: " + String(messageCounter);
// Change to any custom message format
```

### Frequency Configuration
For different regions, modify:
```cpp
#define LORA_FREQUENCY 915    // US: 915, EU: 868
```

## üß™ Testing Scenarios

### 1. Close Range Test (0-5 meters)
- **Setup**: Both devices on same desk/table
- **Expected**: Perfect communication, strong RSSI (-40 to -60 dBm)
- **Purpose**: Verify basic functionality

### 2. Indoor Range Test (5-50 meters)
- **Setup**: Devices in different rooms
- **Expected**: Good communication, moderate RSSI (-60 to -90 dBm)
- **Purpose**: Test through walls and obstacles

### 3. Outdoor Range Test (50-1000+ meters)
- **Setup**: Line-of-sight outdoor environment
- **Expected**: Excellent range, variable RSSI (-70 to -120 dBm)
- **Purpose**: Maximum range evaluation

### 4. Urban Environment Test
- **Setup**: City environment with buildings
- **Expected**: Reduced range due to obstacles
- **Purpose**: Real-world performance assessment

## üìà Performance Metrics

### Signal Strength (RSSI) Guidelines
| RSSI Range | Quality | Expected Performance |
|------------|---------|---------------------|
| -30 to -60 dBm | Excellent | Perfect communication |
| -60 to -80 dBm | Good | Reliable communication |
| -80 to -100 dBm | Fair | Occasional packet loss |
| -100 to -120 dBm | Poor | Frequent packet loss |
| Below -120 dBm | Very Poor | Unreliable communication |

### Expected Range
| Environment | Estimated Range |
|-------------|----------------|
| Indoor (WiFi interference) | 50-200m |
| Urban (buildings, obstacles) | 500m-1km |
| Suburban (some obstacles) | 1-2km |
| Rural (line of sight) | 2-5km |
| Open field (ideal conditions) | 3-10km |

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### No Communication Between Devices

**Check List:**
- [ ] Both devices powered on and initialized successfully
- [ ] Wiring connections secure (especially UART cross-connection)
- [ ] Same frequency configured on both devices (915MHz)
- [ ] Both devices in transparent mode (M0=0, M1=0)
- [ ] Antennas connected (if using external antennas)

**Solutions:**
1. **Restart both devices** and check initialization messages
2. **Verify wiring** using the wiring guide
3. **Check power supply** - ensure adequate current for transmission
4. **Test with devices closer together** (< 1 meter)

### Intermittent Communication

**Possible Causes:**
- Weak signal strength (check RSSI values)
- Electromagnetic interference
- Power supply instability
- Loose connections

**Solutions:**
1. **Move devices closer** to improve signal strength
2. **Check environment** for interference sources (WiFi, Bluetooth, microwaves)
3. **Verify power connections** and consider adding decoupling capacitors
4. **Re-seat all connections** on breadboard

### Module Initialization Failure

**Error Message**: "LoRa initialization failed!"

**Solutions:**
1. **Check power connections** (VCC, GND)
2. **Verify AUX pin connection** (GPIO18)
3. **Check mode pins** (M0=GPIO4, M1=GPIO5)
4. **Try different ESP32 board** to rule out hardware issues

### Poor Signal Strength

**If RSSI is consistently poor (-100 dBm or worse):**
1. **Check antenna connections**
2. **Reduce distance between devices**
3. **Ensure line-of-sight communication**
4. **Verify transmission power setting**

## üîÑ Next Steps

After successful testing:

1. **Range Testing**: Gradually increase distance to find maximum reliable range
2. **Integration**: Use these working modules with the main SideQuester code
3. **Optimization**: Experiment with different power levels and channels
4. **Enclosure**: Design weatherproof enclosures for outdoor use
