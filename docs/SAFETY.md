# Safety and Legal Guide

This guide covers important safety considerations, legal requirements, and ethical guidelines for SideQuester operation.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Safety Considerations

### Battery Safety

#### Li-ion Battery Handling
- **Never short circuit** battery terminals
- **Use proper charging circuits** with over-charge protection
- **Monitor temperature** during charging and operation
- **Never leave charging unattended** for extended periods
- **Store batteries** at 40-60% charge for long-term storage
- **Dispose properly** at designated battery recycling centers

#### Charging Safety
```cpp
// Battery monitoring code
float batteryVoltage = readBatteryVoltage();

if(batteryVoltage < 3.0) {
  // Critical low voltage - shut down immediately
  enterDeepSleep();
} else if(batteryVoltage < 3.4) {
  // Low battery warning
  displayLowBatteryWarning();
}
```

#### Signs of Battery Problems
- **Swelling or deformation**
- **Excessive heat during charging**
- **Rapid discharge**
- **Charging that never completes**
- **Metallic smell or corrosion**

### Electrical Safety

#### Assembly Precautions
- **Always disconnect power** before wiring changes
- **Use ESD protection** when handling electronic components
- **Double-check connections** before applying power
- **Start with low power** for initial testing
- **Use fuses or current limiters** where appropriate

#### Operating Environment
- **Avoid water exposure** unless properly weatherproofed
- **Operating temperature**: -10¬∞C to +60¬∞C typical
- **Storage temperature**: -20¬∞C to +70¬∞C
- **Humidity**: <85% non-condensing
- **Altitude**: <3000m for optimal GPS performance

### GPS and Location Privacy

#### Privacy Considerations
- **Inform all users** about location tracking
- **Obtain consent** before tracking others
- **Data stays local** - not transmitted to external servers
- **Consider local privacy laws** and regulations
- **Respect others' privacy** when using in public spaces

#### Location Accuracy
- **GPS accuracy**: Typically 3-5 meters under good conditions
- **Degraded performance** indoors, under trees, near buildings
- **Cold start time**: 30 seconds to several minutes
- **Battery impact**: GPS is power-intensive

## üì° Radio Regulations and Legal Compliance

### LoRa Frequency Bands

#### United States (FCC)
- **Frequency**: 902-928 MHz (ISM band)
- **Maximum Power**: 1W (30 dBm)
- **Duty Cycle**: No restrictions for spread spectrum
- **Antenna Gain**: Up to 6 dBi without restrictions

#### Europe (ETSI)
- **Frequency**: 863-870 MHz (SRD band)
- **Maximum Power**: 25 mW (14 dBm)
- **Duty Cycle**: 1% per hour (36 seconds per hour maximum)
- **Antenna Gain**: Up to 2.15 dBi

#### Other Regions
- **Canada**: Same as US (902-928 MHz)
- **Australia**: 915-928 MHz ISM band
- **Asia**: Varies by country, commonly 920-925 MHz
- **Check local regulations** before operation

### Compliance Requirements

#### Device Configuration
```cpp
// Regional frequency configuration
#if defined(REGION_US)
  #define LORA_FREQUENCY 915
  #define MAX_POWER 30        // dBm
#elif defined(REGION_EU)  
  #define LORA_FREQUENCY 868
  #define MAX_POWER 14        // dBm
  #define DUTY_CYCLE_LIMIT 36000  // ms per hour
#endif
```

#### Legal Operation
- **Use only approved frequencies** for your region
- **Respect power limits** as defined by local regulations
- **Implement duty cycle limits** where required
- **Use type-approved modules** when available
- **Avoid interference** with licensed services

### Amateur Radio Considerations

If you hold an amateur radio license, you may have access to additional frequencies and higher power levels, but must follow amateur radio regulations:

- **Station identification** requirements
- **Third-party traffic** restrictions  
- **Emergency communication** protocols
- **Proper band plans** and frequency coordination

## üåßÔ∏è Environmental and Weather Considerations

### Outdoor Operation

#### Weather Resistance
- **IP65 or higher** rating recommended for outdoor use
- **Sealed enclosures** for rain protection
- **Drainage** to prevent water accumulation
- **Temperature compensation** for battery and GPS

#### Environmental Factors
- **Rain/Snow**: Can affect LoRa propagation
- **Temperature**: Extreme temperatures affect battery life
- **Humidity**: Can cause condensation in enclosure
- **Wind**: May affect device orientation and compass readings

### Enclosure Design

#### Requirements
```
- Weatherproof rating: IP65 minimum
- Material: UV-resistant plastic or anodized aluminum
- Antenna mounting: External weatherproof connector
- Display window: Anti-reflective, UV-resistant
- Charging port: Sealed when not in use
- Mounting points: For belts, backpacks, or vehicles
```

#### Thermal Management
- **Ventilation** without compromising waterproofing
- **Thermal mass** to reduce temperature fluctuations
- **Component placement** to avoid hotspots
- **Color choice** affects solar heating (white reflects heat)

## üèîÔ∏è Outdoor Activity Safety

### Festival and Event Use

#### Responsible Use
- **Respect venue rules** about electronic devices
- **Don't interfere** with venue communications
- **Be considerate** of others around you
- **Follow local laws** about radio transmissions
- **Have backup plans** in case of device failure

#### Group Coordination
- **Test devices beforehand** to ensure compatibility
- **Establish protocols** for device failure
- **Share emergency contact information**
- **Set reasonable range expectations**
- **Plan meeting points** as backup

### Wilderness and Remote Area Use

#### Safety Precautions
- **Not a substitute** for proper navigation equipment
- **Carry backup** navigation tools (map, compass)
- **Inform others** of your planned route and return time
- **Emergency communications** - consider satellite communicators
- **Weather monitoring** and appropriate gear

#### Environmental Impact
- **Leave No Trace** principles
- **Proper disposal** of batteries and electronic waste
- **Respect wildlife** and natural habitats
- **Follow local regulations** for electronic devices in protected areas

## üö® Emergency Considerations

### Emergency Features

#### SOS Mode Implementation
```cpp
void activateSOSMode() {
  // Flash LED in SOS pattern
  // Increase LoRa transmission power
  // Send emergency beacon every 30 seconds
  // Display emergency status
  // Log GPS coordinates
}
```

#### Emergency Protocol
1. **SOS activation** - long press power button
2. **Increased transmission** - send location every 30 seconds
3. **Visual indicators** - flashing LED, display message
4. **Audio alerts** - beeper if available
5. **Battery conservation** - essential functions only

### Device Limitations

#### What SideQuester Cannot Do
- **Not a satellite communicator** - no external network access
- **Limited range** - typically 1-3km depending on terrain
- **Not waterproof** unless properly enclosed
- **Battery dependent** - finite operating time
- **GPS dependent** - doesn't work well indoors

#### Backup Planning
- **Primary navigation tools** should be separate
- **Communication backup** - satellite messenger for emergencies
- **Power backup** - extra batteries or solar charging
- **Manual procedures** if electronic devices fail
